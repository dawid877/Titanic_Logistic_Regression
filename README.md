# Titanic Survival Prediction with Logistic Regression

The goal of this project was to build a predictive model using **logistic regression** to estimate the likelihood of a passenger surviving the Titanic disaster.  
Survival is encoded as a binary outcome: 1 for survived, 0 for not survived.

The following steps were performed during the modeling process:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Train-test split
- Feature encoding
- Logistic regression modeling
- Evaluation metrics
- Cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Key Packages:** `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `plotly`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `numpy`

## Project Structure
- `Titanic ML Project.ipynb` — Core Python notebook  
- `Titanic ML Project.html` — HTML version of the notebook  
- `titanic.csv` — Dataset used in the analysis  
  > This file must be in the same directory when running the notebook
